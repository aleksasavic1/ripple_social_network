This is a social network I've named 'ripple'. There's already a company named Ripple, though I'm not sure what they 
do exactly, but I've used their logo and company name as an example for creating a social network.

I've created an API on mockAPI.io, hoping there won't be any issues with my project in the future. The API is named 
Social Network and includes two resources: users and posts (only two resources are free, any more than that requires 
payment). 
The first resource, users, contains: id, email, username, password. 
The second resource, posts, contains: id, user_id, content, likes.

RESPONSIVENESS OF THE WEBSITE HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED AND IT IS ADAPTED TO ALL DEVICES. :))
