To start a server on your local host, you can use Python. Simply navigate to this directory in your command 
prompt and enter:
python -m http.server

After that, your command prompt will show you the host and port where the server is running, for example:
localhost:8000

Just enter this in your browser.

Alternatively, you can also use node.js by typing in the command prompt:
http-server
It should run on port:
http://127.0.0.1:8080/
Enter this in your browser's address bar.

(there are many other ways to run a server on localhost; you can find tutorials online. Additionally, you can 
find instructions for installing Python and node.js on the internet.)
